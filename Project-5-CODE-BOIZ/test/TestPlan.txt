Testing Basic Functionality:
    Addition: 1 + 2 + (3 will display) 4 + (7 will display) + 15 = 22
    Subtraction: 22 - 15 - (7 will display) 4 - (3 will display) 2 = 1
    Multiplication: 1 * 1 * (1 will display) 3 * (3 will display) * 0 = 0
    Division: 45 / 5 / (9 will display) 3 / (3 will display) 3 = 1
    Equals: 1 + 1 = 2 + 3 = 5
    Decimal:1.5 + 1.6 = 3.1 --- .1 * 10 = 1 --- try pressing 1..2 or 1.2.1 it will not work
    Delete: Enter a number and when the delete key is pressed the right most digit is removed.
        If the number is 1 then display shows 0
    C: Clears current computation. e.g. `5 + C 1 + 3 =` should display 4
    CE: Only clears what's on the display. e.g. `5 + 3 CE + 2 =` should display 7

	-With the default 0 on the screen, press decimal. Press once more, the decimal will only appear one time as valid for a number.

	-Test case where no value is added after the decimal and subtract or add another whole integer to see what value is displayed.  This helps to make sure decimal is appearing in correct context and being used efficiently.
	
	-Trying the negative/positive function to try on an unexpected value such as 0.  Correctly doesn't change the value and display of the value of 0.

	-Test negative against negative values, such as -1 - -1 to make sure the correct validation of -2 has happened.  Additionally tested all operations as well for all cases.  Such as division by a negative value, having a negative value divided by a negative, negative times a positive, negative times a negative.  All cases proved successful.

Testing power functions (sqrt(x), x^2, x^3, 1/x):
    - Each of these functions acts on the number currently displayed

    sqrt(x): `5 + 9 sqrt =` should display 8

    x^2: `5 + 9 x^2 =` should display 86

    x^3: `5 + 9 x^3 =` should display 734

    1/x: `5 + 9 1/x =` should display 5.1111 (repeating)
         `5 + 0 1/x =` should display 5 (1/x on 0 will return 0)
